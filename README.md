# 6 Ws 
## What
This is me preparing for an upcoming Linux Apprenctice Test in my relatively near future.  In short, I'm trying to exercise my lats.

## Why
I like to over-prepare, if that's even possible, for tests.  Besides, I like to learn.

## Who
I'm not the only one who would like to prepare, practice, and pontificate.

## Where
I've done work towards this goal before, [Peke Ito](https://github.com/hark130/Peke_Ito), but I wanted all of my effort in one location, organized according to the topic list I have.

## When
In my free time.

## How
* Proof of concept code
* Exercises (overhead pulldown, seated row, pull up, etc)
* Writing tests (What better way to understand material than to write tests for it?)
* Research
* Practice

# Task List
1. Linux Bash
2. Linux Interaction
3. Linux Internals
4. Linux User Mode Development
5. Linux Kernel Development
